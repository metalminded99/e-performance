				<h2>Using Ruby?</h2>
				<p>
					This template was developed with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/" target="_blank">Middleman</a> and includes .erb layouts and views.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of the views you see here (sign in, sign up, users, etc) are already split up so you don't have to waste your time doing it yourself!
				</p>
				<p>
					The layout.erb file includes the header, footer, and side navigation and all of the views are broken out into their own files.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you aren't using Ruby, there is also a set of plain HTML files for each page, just like you would expect.
